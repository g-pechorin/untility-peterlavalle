
This is a "mee too" code dump of extension methods and utility classes for Unity.

## [puntility](puntility.unitypackage) 

A bunch of extension methods that I'm fond of.
Also has a nice class to make ScriptedObject asset creation easier.

## [input-property](input-property.unitypackage) 

It's a neat class for controls.
